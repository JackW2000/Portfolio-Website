    <h1 class="titleAnim">> Music Genre Classification</h1>
    <h5 class="author">jack</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Produced as my university dissertation project, this repository contains a machine learning project that is able
        to extract and ingest data from audio files, and then make predictions as to the genre of the file based on the
        features.</p>
    <p>This piece of work is one that I am extremely proud of as it was my first time working with a lot of the
        technologies and concepts involved.</p>
    <p>The project consists of 3 key portions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feature Extraction</li>
        <li>Model Creation, Training, and Tuning</li>
        <li>Cloud Hosting of Models</li>

    <p>A Generative Adversarial Network that uses the MNIST dataset in order to produce handwritten numbers.</p>
    <p>I produced this project as hobby work to play around with some more machine learning technology as it's something
        I find interesting.</p>
    <p>The output of the 25 epochs from running this model are also included in the repository.</p>

    <h1 class="titleAnim">> Common Algorithms and Problems</h1>
    <h5 class="author">jack</h5>
    <br>
    <p>This project was started during my final year of university as a way to both practice my programming across a
        variety of languages, and also to provide a resource to assist newer developers with implementing these
        solutions for themselves.</p>
    <p>Each implementation is fully commented so that whoever looks at it is able to follow what the code is doing. I
        chose to do this in order to provide a teaching resource for those that need it.</p>
    <p>Currently, this repository covers the following languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>Go</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Kotlin</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Scala</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There's a full list of the implemented algorithms/concepts in the repo's readme, along with which languages it
        has been implemented using.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Another piece of work produced for university, this project contains a barebones operating system designed to be
        run on the Motorola 68HC11 microcontroller.</p>
    <p>The assignment asked that the operating system included functionality to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate functionality using a menu</li>
        <li>Display the contents of memory</li>
        <li>Modify the contents of memory</li>
        <li>Load a file over a serial connection into memory</li>
        <li>Disassemble code from hexedecimal to assembly language</li>
        <li>Demo mode that turns a motor using a variable resistor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not all of the above were required, but were advised. Any additional functionality was awarded extra credit.</p>

    <h5 class="author">jack</h5>
    <br>
    <p>This repo contains my submitted assignment for the second half of my final year hardware and embedded systems
        module at uni. The requirement for this assignment was to use the graphical programming language LabView to
        produce a mock reactor cooling system to run on a MyRIO FPGA.</p>
    <p>The assignment required the submitted code to include functionality to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Run both on a remote PC and MyRIO FPGA simultaneously</li>
        <li>Report sensor details from the MyRIO to the PC</li>
        <li>Allow user configuration via the PC controller</li>
        <li>Include mock anti-theft measures (remote override on MyRIO)</li>
        <li>Automatically engage a cooling fan based on sensor temps</li>
        <li>Signal a warning should temps become unsafe</li>
        <li>Allow remote override for all functionality via PC interface</li>
        <li>Have the MyRIO and PC connect with each other via Wi-Fi</li>

    <p>Kotlin based Android application utilising the Trefle API.</p>
    <p>This application was produced to be a gardener's best friend, and provide easy access to plants and all of their
        details. The application also provided functionality for the user to add plants to their collection so that any
        relevant details could be accessed offline.</p>
    <p>Sadly, the Trefle API was closed shortly after this application was produced, however, it appears that Mashum has
        recently backed the project, and the API is going to be returning!</p>

    <p>The first repository contains a Python script that continually polls a provided URL for changes to the webpage.
        If a change is made, the script will notify the user.</p>
    <p>This script is relatively basic, with the URL being set directly within the script. Windows toast notifications
        are used to inform the user when a change is detected.</p>

    <p>The second repository contains a similar script, however, this variation is configured to be used as a Discord
        bot.</p>
    <p>This bot is able to run locally or hosted remotely, and has additional functionality that can be set via
        Discord command shortcuts, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start Monitoring</li>
        <li>Stop Monitoring</li>
        <li>Set Site URL</li>

    <p>Advent Of Code is an initiative that runs yearly to encourage developers to solve a range of issues as fast and
        as efficiently as possible.</p>
    <p>2022 was my first year participating in the program, and I initially planned on solving each problem using a
        different language. Though I didn't keep this up, I was able to solve the majority of the problems that came up.
        I will be taking part again in 2023, hopefully solving all the problems this time around.</p>
